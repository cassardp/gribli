# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** March 2025

Gribli is built with privacy in mind. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Our Commitment

Gribli collects minimal data, limited to what is necessary for the leaderboard feature.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
Your game progress and settings are stored locally on your device.

### Leaderboard
If you choose to submit your score to the leaderboard, the following data is stored on our servers:
- Your chosen display name
- Your score

This data is stored using Supabase, a secure cloud platform. No other personal information is collected or linked to your leaderboard entry.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (email, phone, etc.)
- Usage analytics
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Browsing history
- Any form of tracking

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties.

## Children's Privacy

Gribli does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. Leaderboard participation is optional and only requires a display name.

## Your Rights

- **Access:** View your score on the leaderboard at any time
- **Delete:** Delete the app to remove all local data
- **Opt out:** Simply don't submit scores to avoid any data collection

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.
